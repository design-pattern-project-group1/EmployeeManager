# EmployeeManager

This is the Answer to Qn 3. we used Composite, Singleton, Repository and MVC Patterns. We used Asp.Net
for Server Hosting, Razor Pages and bootstrap for Rendering the Views and very few built in MVC functionalities 
other than that we used no Built in Features.

We Might Make some Modifications in the Future But It's Ready to Be Graded at this Moment. Please look in Services
Directory to Find Repository and Singleton Pattern and Models Directory to Find Composite Pattern's Implementation.

Thank you!
